# azKPI ‚Äî Decentralized Task Management Platform

## Overview

azKPI is a decentralized task management solution powered by the Sui blockchain, designed for individuals and organizations seeking transparency, security, and privacy in managing their workflows. The system integrates **Walrus** for decentralized file/content storage and **Seal** for robust content encryption, ensuring both on-chain data integrity and off-chain privacy.

## Development Setup

### Install Sui CLI

Before deploying your move code, ensure that you have installed the Sui CLI. You
can follow the [Sui installation instruction](https://docs.sui.io/build/install)
to get everything set up.

This application uses `testnet` by default, so we'll need to set up a testnet
environment in the CLI:

```bash
sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env testnet
```

If you haven't set up an address in the sui client yet, you can use the
following command to get a new address:

```bash
sui client new-address secp256k1
```

This will generate a new address and recovery phrase for you. You can mark a
newly created address as your active address by running the following command
with your new address:

```bash
sui client switch --address 0xYOUR_ADDRESS...
```

We can ensure we have some Sui in our new wallet by requesting Sui from the
faucet `https://faucet.sui.io`.

### Publishing the Move Package

The Move code for this application is located in the `move/task_manager` directory. To publish
it, you can enter the directory and publish it with the Sui CLI:

```bash
cd move/task_manager
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

In the output there will be an object with a `"packageId"` property. You'll want
to save that package ID to the `src/constants.ts` file:

```ts
export const TESTNET_TASK_MANAGER_PACKAGE_ID = "<YOUR_PACKAGE_ID>";
```

Now that we have published the Move code and updated the package ID, we can
start the app.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies you can run

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start your dApp in development mode run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To build your app for deployment you can run

```bash
pnpm build
```
